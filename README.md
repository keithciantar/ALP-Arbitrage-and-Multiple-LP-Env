# Optimal Automated Market Makers - Dissertation

Welcome to the repository for my dissertation titled "Optimal Automated Market Makers." This repository contains the code and resources related to my research on automated market makers and their optimization.

## Python Files

### OneTradeTestingArbitrage.py

This Python file includes code related to the testing and analysis of arbitrage opportunities within automated market makers. The implementation and results discussed in Chapter 2 can be found in this file.

### MultipleLPs.py

The `MultipleLPs.py` file corresponds to Chapter 3 of the dissertation. It contains code that is relevant to the exploration of multiple liquidity providers within automated market makers. This file presents the practical implementation and outcomes discussed in Chapter 3.

Both of these Python files can be located in the `Notebooks` folder.
